# BartenderToggle--Cataclysm-4.3
 A World of Warcraft Addon for Cataclysm 4.3.4

This addon allows you to bind a key to a bartender bar. While you hold the key down you can show the bartender bar, and then when you release it, the bar will hide itself. This gives you the ability to create utility bars that don't clog up your screen space or the ability to create your won bar with functionality similar to that of oPie.
